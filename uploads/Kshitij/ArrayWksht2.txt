Array Review Worksheet

1. What is an array in Java?

	It's a data structure which stores multiple values.

2. Declare a 2-dimensional array called table of base type int with 4 rows and 5
columns in each row.

	int[][] table = new int[4][5];

3. Write two printArray methods such that the method name is overloaded. One
method should print a 1D array and the other should print a 2D array.

	1D -
	
	public static void printArray(int[] arr) {
		for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
			System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
		}
	}
		
	2D - 
	
	public static void printArray(int[][] arr) {
		for (int r = 0; r < arr.length; r++)
      	  	{
            	for(int c = 0; c < arr[0].length; c++)
            	{
                	System.out.print(arr[r][c] + " ");
            	}
            	System.out.println();
        	}
	}

4. Write some Java code that will declare an array named entry that has length 3,
has SalesAssociate as its base type, and is filled with 3 identical records. The
records use the name “Jane Doe” and sales of $5000. Use a for loop.
Assume the SalesAssociate class looks like the following:

	public class SalesAssociate
	{
		private String name;
		private double sales;
		public SalesAssociate(String initialName, double initialSales)
		{
  			this.name = initialName;
  			this.sales = initialSales;
		}
	}

	I dont understand this question at all. The private class threw me off.	

5. Consider the list {13, 9, 15, 2}. Show the list after each iteration of the outer
loop for bubble and selection sorting algorithms.

Bubble     Selection
13 9 15 2  13 9 15 2

for (int i = 0; i < Bubble.length; i++) {
	System.out.println(Bubble[i]);
}

This is basically a guess, I can hardly tell what this question means. Isnt list a keyword in java? And what is a Selection algorithm.
