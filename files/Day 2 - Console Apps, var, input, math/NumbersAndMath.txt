Minor - Copy this code to a java file called NumbersAndMath

public class NumbersAndMath
{
	public static void main( String[] args )
	{
		System.out.println( "I will now count my chickens:" );

		System.out.println( "Hens " + ( 25 + 30 / 6 ) );
		System.out.println( "Roosters " + ( 100 - 25 * 3 % 4 ) );

		System.out.println( "Now I will count the eggs:" );

		System.out.println( 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6 );

		System.out.println( "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?" );

		System.out.println( 3 + 2 < 5 - 7 );

		System.out.println( "What is 3 + 2? " + ( 3 + 2 ) );
		System.out.println( "What is 5 - 7? " + ( 5 - 7 ) );

		System.out.println( "Oh, that's why it's false." );

		System.out.println( "How about some more." );

		System.out.println( "Is it greater? " + ( 5 > -2 ) );
		System.out.println( "Is it greater or equal? " + ( 5 >= -2 ) );
		System.out.println( "Is it less or equal? " + ( 5 <= -2 ) );
	}
}

Tasks: 

1.Above each line, use two slashes // to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.

2. Notice the math seems "wrong"? There are no fractions, only whole numbers. Why is this? 

3. Rewrite NumbersAndMath.java to use decimals so it's more accurate (hint: 20.0 is a double).
