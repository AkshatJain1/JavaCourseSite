major grade - write an IN-DEPTH *user-friendly* application, called DataBlender.

You will ask the user for all 4 primitive data types and String.

It is up to you to use operations to mix and match and come up with a
result that is completely different than what the user entered.

In the comments, please describe the technique that you used.

You will submit the code to me tomorrow and be graded based on the amount of 
*effort*, usability and variety that you include.

Also it has to be cool.
