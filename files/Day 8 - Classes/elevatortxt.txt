       write a class Elevator that has:

        max floors
	current floor
	num of people
	weight limit
	current weight
	manufacturingCompany
	cost (of the elevator)





     in the main class, ask the user how they want to create their elevator - how many floors it will         have, its weight limit, manufacturing company, cost

     then loop to manage people coming in/out. ex:	
     1. Person in
     2. Person out
     3. Floor up
     4. Floor down
     Enter option: 1
     What is the weight of the person: 150

     1. Person in
     2. Person out
     3. Floor up
     4. Floor down
     Enter option: 3
     The floor is now 4     

     Keep a track of the weight of the elevator and notify the user if weight limit is within 100           pounds of being reached (you would have to ask the weight of each person going in/out)
