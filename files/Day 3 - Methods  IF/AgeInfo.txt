Minor - Take in a user's age. Output whether they are eligible to vote.

If they are, tell them how many years they were eligible to vote and if they aren't tell them how many years until they can start voting.


Then output if their age would be even or odd next year.

Finally, if the user is eligible to vote, tell the user how many elections they have voted in.

Hint: Keep in mind that elections are held every four years, and that the last election was in 2016. And, ASSUME THE CURRENT YEAR IS ALWAYS 2018


Example:

Enter your age: 15

Sorry, you are short 3 years of being able to vote.

Next year, your age will be an even number. Isn't that interesting?



Example 2:

Enter your age: 28

Wow, you have been voting for 10 years!

Next year, your age will be an odd number. Cool!

So far, you have participated in 3 elections. That is 3 more than me!


Note: Be creative with your outputs. Don't use the same exact language as I did.
