Write a program which takes in a number (in decimal) from the user and then converts it to binary.

Keep looping this, and use methods as applicable.

When they enter a negative number, exit loop and end program.

Example:

Enter a number: 23
23 in binary is 010111

Enter a number: 5
101

Enter a number: -1

Goodbye :)
