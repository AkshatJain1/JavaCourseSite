Write a program that creates a 2D int array with user input.

Take in the number of rows and columns from the user and ask the user for each value.

At the end, print out the resulting array.

Example:

Rows?: 2
Columns?: 2

Position (0,0)?: 6
Position (0,1)?: 2
Position (1,0)?: 4
Position (1,1)?: 0
 
6 2
4 0
