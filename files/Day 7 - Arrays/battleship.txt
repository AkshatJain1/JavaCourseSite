Major - This will be your hardest program yet.

You will code a game of battleship against the computer. 



 *create an array of 5x5 spots in a theoretical ocean.

 *set all values to X 	

 *set some random spots to be "ships". These spots cannot be duplicated, if they are, randomize again			
 *keep asking the user to guess the row, col	
	
 *they can't enter something that's not valid

 * if they miss, set the value at that spot to a M

 *if they hit, set the value at that spot to a H

 *when they hit all the ships that they need, they are done and they won

 *you lose when everything but at least one ship is M 

 *Print out the number of turns it took them to hit all the ships if they won.
